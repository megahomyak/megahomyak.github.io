SocHi value changers:
* Multipliers: the more you have, the more you get
* Adders: no matter how much do you have, you will get this amount
* Subtractors: no matter how much do you have, you will lose this amount
* Setters: no matter how much do you have, you will lose everything and get this amount

The questions of /awareness/:
* Why are some people destined to suffer and some are destined to strive?
* What one needs to do if he's invaluable?

More topics, in order:
* Why "society is fair" is a false statement
* Why every human is selfish
* On valuable and invaluable people
* Why genes are determining one's success
* Why one's intentions only matter to oneself
* Why centralized control is bad (since we can't know the real intentions EVER, it is easier to just throw a dice)

"Making for the invaluable":
    "Be aware that a lot of the invaluable people may have awful life conditions, so you should ideally think of sharing your product offline, since Internet access is still a privilege. Going for the illiterate people, though, is not something I would consider worthy. These are the people who suffer the most - yes, but reaching them is practically impossible."
