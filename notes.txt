SocHi value changers:
* Multipliers: the more you have, the more you get
* Adders: no matter how much do you have, you will get this amount
* Subtractors: no matter how much do you have, you will lose this amount
* Setters: your value will be set to this if it was lower

Questions of /awareness/:
* Why are some people destined to suffer and some are destined to strive?
* What one needs to do if he's invaluable?

More topics, in order:
* Why "society is fair" is a false statement
* Why every human is selfish
* On valuable and invaluable people
* Why genes are determining one's success
* Why one's intentions only matter to oneself
* Why centralized control is bad (since we can't know the real intentions EVER, it is easier to just throw a dice)
* Why invaluable people love chaos (since they can only control the very small things in their lives, their happiest moments happened because of chaos (and the worst ones also), so when they can choose the pleasant chaos, it is even more pleasant because it also links with their good memories of chaos) - or something like this, IDK, draft

"Making for the invaluable":
    "Be aware that a lot of the invaluable people may have awful life conditions, so you should ideally think of sharing your product offline, since Internet access is still a privilege. Going for the illiterate people, though, is not something I would consider worthy. These are the people who suffer the most - yes, but reaching them is practically impossible."

SHT briefly, unfinished draft:

<text>
Society is a group of people who use each other. We are existing now because our main goals are replication and survival, which are regulated by our instincts, and everything else builds on top. Since our primary goals are about ourselves, we are selfish, so when we choose people to use, we choose the best ones.

People are born with different talents (and different levels of those talents; there may be the case when a person has no talents at all or the case when a person is extremely talented in a lot of contexts), and help with development to become even better are getting only the best ones, the worst ones will have no help at all and have to go alone all the time. The talented are usually successful, and since they're good, they're good as a tool, including breeding. After they have kids (also genetically talented, from the highly likely talented both parents, since it is unprofitable for the talented to use the untalented for breeding), they will make their already talented kids even better by helping them become better, so they will have an even greater boost than their parents.

A context (the in-theory term) is a set of human occupations. TODO!!!

After some time, the gap between the valuable and invaluable becomes so big that there is no hope left for the invaluable to be useful.
