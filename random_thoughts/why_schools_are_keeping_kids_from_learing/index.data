Painpoints:
* Cramming instead of learing
* No application for knowledge (in the process of studying)
* No reason to learn => no productive learing
* Slow learners have to be faster somehow (mention the strategies for fast learners to go around the system)
* One goal of the factory model of education is to make the child think in patterns (=> weed out the out-of-the-box thinking); the second goal is to put the "right" values into schoolers

Solution:
You learn "free roam" with government-provided free classes => you prove that you understand the topic => you get a mark in some kind of governmental ledger => you study further. Punishment for not studying. Explain why something is important with _practical examples_ and not some abstract bullshit somewhere around "math is important because it is used in programming" (not in all programming, even). This will encourage people to study more because they can learn what they want when they can, but they will need to study more and more, but they will actually feel a need for studying. The employees will probably look at the government ledger to know what a person really knows. There will probably be some courses that gather the same literally old-school subjects, but people will assign to them willingly.
Also, there will be ways of studying that will have a lot of funny, fascinating practice, so that the studying process will be both exciting and effective, leaving the student with a bunch of cool projects and memorable practical experience.

# Why schools are keeping kids from learning

## About the factory model of education

### What is it

Our current educational system exists for centuries, with not that much major changes made to it. Somewhere around the end of 18th century, when the industrialization began and the world needed workers, schools were reformed to fulfill the needs of the epoch. Classes were starting and ending with a bell. Students were separated into groups by their age. Lessons were told by a single teacher for a big group of students, usually between 20 and 35 people. Lessons were the same for everyone in an age-based group, and the curriculum was strict. How well one knows the subject was measured by standardized tests.

Separation of the rest periods from the work periods with a bell, a strict schedule and standartization were some of the main things that awaited a new factory worker.

Nowadays, we still have the same system.

### How it affects an individual

#### Cramming instead of learning

The goal of the factory education is not to produce people who understand something, but to produce people who are able to work; and then take a new set of people to educate. The teachers are not willing to make one understand something, they need to make one pass the tests. This results in teachers sometimes not explaining the topic, but instead advising to memorize it. This keeps their workload smaller (while providing more room for the school-related bureaucracy and preparation for the other lessons) and it makes students pass the tests for a good metric to the upper management, so this way is comfortable for the teachers and thus preferred. Not to mention the low wages for teachers in at least Russia (not including Moscow and Saint-Petersburg) that make a teacher's job less valuable and interesting, making the teachers want to just finish a lesson somehow and call it a day.

#### Ignorance to student's life priorities

If a student for some reason doesn't have enough free time to study outside of school (for example, looking after a sick relative or little siblings or working to make a living), his performance will greatly degrade, resulting in him looking stupid or lazy, preventing him or making much harder for him to study further when the bad times are over.

#### Forced activities

When one is forced to do something, he probably won't like doing it, because this activity is highly unlikely to be what he wants to do right now. By forcing the individual to study, the individual starts thinking of studying as a tedious process, and this attitude will spread onto his non-school life.

#### No reason to learn

For the entire time spent in school, it is not guaranteed that one will receive the information about why is he forced to learn. Sometimes, the question "why should I learn?" is considered stupid by both teachers and parents, so they don't answer it and rebuke the child for asking it. Sometimes, even parents or teachers don't know the answer or they think that the child has the same life experience as them, so they leave the child with a very abstract saying like "you need to study because you will need it in the future". Of course, this is not enough and leaves more questions than answers. And one's classmates may be in the same situation. This all results in no easy way to get the answer, and the surrounding people (such as classmates) may even support the point of uselessness of learning. Without the answer for such an important question, the learning process will be incredibly ineffective. Meanwhile, the person in question may not know what he wants to do in life, so he will not discover why learning is useful until his adulthood, when life suddenly becomes complicated and everybody awaits from the person to have at least some degree of knowledge in some fields. At that time, there are no easy social mechanisms that will help the person to simultaneously survive and study, so he, already having a hard time being badly educated, will have an even more hard time of acquiring the missed knowledge.

#### No real-world application of the knowledge

Schools teach us a lot of things, but many people know for certain that they won't need some of the things they are told, so that knowledge just stays unapplied and thus successfully forgotten in the future, resulting in wasted time.

#### No application of the knowledge while studying

Nowadays, we are mostly teaching people abstract ideas and not allowing them to practice what they learned on real-world problems. This leads to a more shallow understanding of the subject and sometimes not understanding why the subject is needed. Math classes may serve as an example: nobody will explain on a math class why are you studying all those things, except some rare real-world related problems, but those are few and typical.

#### Not accounting for slow learners

People who are slowly learning for some reason (our thinking abilities differ) will not be able to keep up with the rest of the students, which will lead to this slow group getting bad grades. In this case, student's grades really do reflect the level of knowledge of the student, so it is not that unfair, but this situation puts a lot of pressure on the underachiever and also makes him more vulnerable to bullying.

At the same time, if the fast learners are bored in school, at least in Russia they can skip a grade or study at home at the pace they need. Also in Russia for the slow learners studying only at home (to pick a well-fitting study plan, the right teachers or not to embarass themselves before the well-learning people) is costly or impossible, because the underperforming individual has to either visit the school and the paid tutors simultaneously or study at home, but provide a notice that he is learning at a full-fledged online school, which also costs money. If the individual does not have enough money, he has to take the tougher road of cheap self-learning.

#### Limiting the minds of students

Factory model education is good at raising submissive humans, which is especially good for their bosses.

##### Making students think in patterns

Modern schools are teaching people solutions to problems, and only rarely students invent the solutions themselves. This combined with teachers who teach to cram (a paragraph on this is above) results in people who are not able to solve a problem without the instruction. This is sufficient for being a factory worker.

##### Putting the "right" values into the minds of students

Schools usually additionally try to teach us two things: political agenda and good morals. The former is obviously biased and will dissolve when the new party will be in charge. From my experience, everything political (or something other that is government-issued) is hated by students, taking their time for nothing. The latter is actually not as good as it may look like. By teaching our children the "good morals", such as "be helpful", "do not lie", "enjoy every little moment of your life" and "obey the law" we are making them much more vulnerable and controllable by the ones who doesn't obey these laws. For example, always willing to help will result in a person being used, not lying will make it much harder to pursue our goals (a lot of times lying will make a better impact than not lying for everyone), finding the beauty in small stops the personal development, and thinking that the law is such a universal rule that it must forever be obeyed limits the understanding of how society works, also limiting one's freedom. Successful people are not successful because they work for the society; successful people are successful because they work for themselves. By limiting ourselves, we're not only worsen our lives, but also making room for our oppressors.

#### Bullying

This topic was already brought up a lot before, but it is very important, so I will elaborate a little on this one. It is obvious that inside a group, where each member is forced to be, situations will exist where an individual will be oppressed by the other individuals. Especially in school, where students are explicitly ranked, and some of them are put on higher places than the others before everyone's eyes. Bullying in school may lead to a very low self-esteem, being distracted from learning or not wanting to go to school at all (and this is a much greater problem if one's parents are too strict and do not allow him to skip school), not to mention the physical and mental traumas that can be received from such an experience.

#### Advanced knowledge is hard to get

Let's jump off the school topic and investigate its surroundings a little. Advanced education, such as universities, is mostly very expensive. Universities sometimes have free places in them, but those are only obtainable for the best learners, and to be one of them one has to survive everything outlined above, while keeping the knowledge level very high, which is very hard without tutors and additional educational resources, which is pricey. Universities have a monopoly of knowledge: a lot of knowledge is owned by them, and classroom lectures cannot even be pirated so easily. Academic journals usually require a paid subscription to read them, and there are not so many publishers to choose from. Various afterschool educational activities are usually paid with no way to get the knowledge for free.

### How it affects the society

Nowadays, many countries are several decades into the informational stage of development, but the educational system in them stays the same. It raises the factory workers, not the scientists. People are told to think in patterns while it's actually the right time not to, and this leads to less people participating in creation of ideas, slowing the progress in all fields of study.

## Perhaps the solution

The solution below is not perfect and not even good. It does not cover some of the points outlined above, but it provides a somewhat-imaginable way of rebuilding the educational system so it will fit more people. It cannot be built on top of the current one, though.

At first, we need to remove the separation by age and separate people by their knowledge level, while giving them the ability to learn what they want, resulting in:

* Greater involvement in classes because of the interest in them
* Less bullying by knowledge level, since everybody will be able to choose
* Easier for slow learners, since they will be able to make their studying process less busy

This way has a bad consequence of not being able to form long-term relationship with the other students. This may be good because it will be harder to identify the weakest person to bully, but friendship will be almost impossible, and that's much more important and likely to happen than bullying.

If everyone will be able to study what they want and when they want, we will need to motivate slackers. We can do this by punishing people for not studying for a while, no matter the age, accounting for the life circumstances.

As for the responsible people, we can motivate them to study by advertizing the skills one can gather thanks to studying and how those skills may be used on real-world tasks. This will also make people understand why is it good to learn certain things. Also, if there will exist governmental exams on lots of topics to check one's knowledge, this may be used as proof for employers that a person can handle the task, and the same information can be used by knowledge providers to find out that the person has sufficient knowledge to understand the subject they're teaching.

Some lessons may include entertaining practice. For example, when studying trigonometry, it may be a good idea to practice it on physics simulations. This will make the studying process both exciting and effective, leaving the student with memorable experience and a good project that he will be proud of.
