# Why every human is selfish

Humans are a result of several millions of years of evolution of living organisms on Earth. To continue existing (and get to where we are now), every human had to do everything to survive until he can reproduce, and also ideally raise the kids so that they won't die while they're still weak. Since evolution is a process of the worst-suited species dying and the best-suited continuing to strive, everything that is not done for the main goals of reproduction and survival (including the survival of offsprings) is wasted time, and species doing something other than only helping themselves are going to lose to more selfish species. Even if some behaviours appear non-selfish (such as protecting the child), they are performed because of instincts, which control the behaviour of an animal (humans are also animals, don't forget about it) and make the animal satisfied. If you look closely at the behaviour of humans, you will find out that everything that humans do they are doing for their profit.

* Love actions are done to make the doer satisfied, releasing dopamine to his brain. Nobody actually cares about the partner itself, only about their own good feeling when their partner is nearby. Such behaviour exists so that humans will reproduce. Sometimes one wants to be protected by the partner, and that's where the instincts of survival take part. One cannot be loved if he cannot be used, because loving equals using, just like all the other human relations.
* Mothers caring about their children is an action controlled by the instincts, without doing which the mothers will feel bad (worried for their child, for example), and to make themselves satisfied they are helping their children, which helps the children to survive.
* Friendship ensues when one feels the need to communicate (which increases the chances for one to get the information that will be helpful in survival) or be protected (straight the need of survival)

You can analyze the other human behaviours and read the works of various psychologists if you want a deep dive into it.

# How can this knowledge be used

Looking at all this, it becomes obvious that the best things one can do is invest only in himself. If somebody tells you to help the others, it's just their own selfishness coming through, since they are raising the chances of getting help for themselves from you. Social propaganda aimed to make people more non-selfish is made for the same reason: the ones spreading it need help, and they need that help from you. If you look at successful people, especially at their biographies and not at their current state, you will find that they were doing everything for their own profit, not helping anyone else. *If everyone will only help themselves, there will be no need to help the others*. Humans who are trying to invest all their time to help the others because of the ideas they were fed throughout their lives will be used and left with nothing, because in every society the most selfish ones will get the most profit.

So, in conclusion:

* Do only the things that are making __you__ the most profit.
* In every situation be greedy and try to get as much as possible for yourself, never missing a chance.
