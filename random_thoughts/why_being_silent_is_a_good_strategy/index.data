# Why being silent is a good strategy

"Being silent" here means "not telling any personal information, no matter the topic, to anyone".

Since every human is selfish (related: ["Why every human is selfish"](../why_every_human_is_selfish)), people only want to use each other. Remember that people are good to you as long as they can get profit from using you, and this profit is higher than the cost of communicating with you. By providing the other people information about yourself, you are making it easier for the others to use you in a way that will be unprofitable for you, such as filtering out the bad information from the received and publishing it, portraying you in a bad light. Such behaviour may seem unprofitable (and thus useless), but it actually has a profit of making the publisher feel better because he dominated over you, which will make competing with him in a society harder.

At the other hand, not opening your good sides may also be good, since if your opponents will try to dominate you while having a value level in the current context lower than yours, then you can dominate them back, resulting in you getting profit.

Moreover, if you will hide any information about you, no one will be able to say that you're hiding something that they can use to dominate. If you will only hide the bad information about yourself, it will become quite clear after some time, and every time you won't want to say something it will be safe enough to assume that you're hiding something bad, which is as bad as saying it straight.

Also, don't forget that the information you may think of as good may actually be very bad in your current context, so it is much more safe to keep the mouth shut than spreading the uncertain.

# Conclusion

Not opening any of your information (and doing so only where it seems absolutely necessary) has these benefits:

* No one will know that you're bad at something, thus closing one way to dominate over you
* No one will know that you're good at something, thus allowing you to reverse the domination direction if somebody less valuable in context of what you was hiding will try to dominate over you
* No one will be able to say that you're hiding the bad if you will hide everything
