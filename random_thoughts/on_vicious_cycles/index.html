<div class="headingContainer"><h2 class="heading" id="definition">Definition</h2><a href="#definition">[anchor]</a></div>
<p>"Vicious cycles" <strong>here</strong> means "a confluence of circumstances leading to an individual's social status lowering indefinitely".</p>
<div class="headingContainer"><h2 class="heading" id="when_do_they_happen">When do they happen</h2><a href="#when_do_they_happen">[anchor]</a></div>
<p>They happen when an individual is very low in a society and his value is also very low. Social status and a person's value are directly dependant on each other, actually: if a person can do nothing, he will not be needed by anyone, and thus will end up at the bottom of the society. On the other hand, if a person is at the bottom of the society, he can't get more valuable, because all of the social institutions require some degree of value. And that's a vicious cycle. For example, a homeless person highly likely will not be allowed at shops as not to scare away customers, and there will be no one to help him in that situation, even if he somehow got the money and wants to buy something. It is highly unlikely for a person at the social bottom to be able to travel long distances or use modern communicational tools such as Internet, so the invaluable person has to rely on local institutions to get help in his situation, but these institutions are not always there. Small towns may serve as an example. Society is not interested in the worst people better, the most profitable action that can be done to them is just leaving them to die, because for any human the other people are no more than tools used to achieve his goals (some of them may seem not selfish, but they are actually backed by the instincts), and there is no reason of upgrading the worst tool over the better ones.</p>

<p>Anti-vicious cycles also exist: if a person is valuable, the other people want to make the person even more valuable and use him (sounds like slavery, but I'm talking about jobs). There are competition for these people, because everyone wants their task to be done with the best tools. Already smart people are getting the educational benefits, already strong people are getting coaches, already rich people can use their money to make even more money (because money gives a lot of power), and so on.</p>
<div class="headingContainer"><h2 class="heading" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><a href="#conclusion">[anchor]</a></div>
<p>Human society does its best at filtering humans: the best ones have all the opportunities to become better and strive for their dreams, while the worst ones have a few opportunities, if any, even, and that's combined with bad life quality (which is a result of being not needed). That's basically the natural selection: the strongest ones will thrive, the weakest ones will die.</p>
