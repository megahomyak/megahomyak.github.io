# Styleguide

<slogan>Because even the greatest knowledge should be conveyed nicely.</slogan>

This styleguide is not mandatory, and there may be some pages that don't obey it, but in general the rules will apply.

## Textual

Each heading should contain a button next to it to copy an anchored hyperlink:

### This is a sample heading

After the first heading defining the name of the webpage, a slogan should be located containing a phrase that unusually sums up the contents of the webpage:

<slogan>Hi, I am a slogan. You've seen my sibling after the first heading of this page.</slogan>

## Visual

Each page should have a different color. The background of the page should be light, and the content should be dark. It can be seen on this page.

<p>Thematic changes (<pre>&lt;br&gt;</pre> in HTML) should look like very bold, wavy lines going through the entire page horizontally:</p>

<br>

Vector images should be the same color as content, with rare exceptions:

<centered monochrome svg>human_hands_up</svg>

Vector images should be small and minimalistic.

Characters on vector images should be limited to three emotions:

<div class="tight centerContentsEvenly"><monochrome svg>happy</svg><monochrome svg>neutral</svg><monochrome svg>sad</svg></div>

Adding unnecessary emotions on images or in text is considered bad and should be avoided.

Each article should end with a vector image related to page's content:

<centered monochrome svg>waves</svg>
</>
