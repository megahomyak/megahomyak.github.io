Blog structure ideas:
* Accessibility - maximum information under maximum restrictions
    * **Accessibility is not only about the disabled people, it is about the underpowered ones, so I should also care about people with slow Internet access, illiterate people and people with no Internet access at all**
    * I should comprise bigger articles out of smaller ones, making the latter also searchable, and this will give my readers the information they want straight away
    * I consider text consumable by everyone (since it can be read visually, listened to or touched) and is also really easy to store and transmit, so I should always make sensible source documents (and they also shouldn't be bloated with unnecessary garbage, so they will be storeable using the least capable permanent storage tools)
    * When making other representations of my thoughts than the source document, I should always consider the visual, hearing and mental disabilities and disorders (so, for example, no animations and anything that will require the user to distinguish colors to understand the meaning; also, no complicated stuff and no stuff that will require a lot of attention - both of these can be removed by presenting the information simply and in a flexible manner (examples of "flexible" may be that the information will be readable in small portions or, say, on a small phone screen)), and also I should consider that my readers may not have modern technology, such as computers, so it must be, for example, printable (and thus not interactive), and the web version should be as light as possible (so it will be (relatively) fast to download over slow connections)

Subjects to explain:
* Why to have your work valued you only have to be lucky
* Why resources are distributed randomly in our society
* People don't like the attitude, people only like results
* Why people care much less about the product than about its wrapping
* Living in restrictions (for underpowered people)
* How society adds struggles (especially in terms of getting more power) for the underpowered and adds possibilities (a synonym for "power") to the overpowered
* Why am I against violence
* Why market economy is unfair, but also is the most fitting economic system for humanity
* How to make your work valued as an underpowered person
* How to make your child miserable (please, don't do it)
* How to interact with people as an underpowered person
    * Why you must not show your weaknesses
    * [describe the idea that when you begin to interact with other people, you become a bother for them (and, of course, mention that you should abide by their rules when talking - this is just being polite)]
    * [describe the idea that when someone begins to interact with you, they should abide your rules and **respect** you or you should drop the dialogue]
* People's reaction to actions of differently-valued persons
* How to make a human do anything
* An observation: [make a section for observations?] opinions of overpowered people are believed instantly, whilst the opinions of underpowered people are never considered [maybe, this should be in a more general article?]
* What to do in life if you are underpowered

Topics to bring up in a more generic fashion:
* Why looking like a child will make people treat you like one no matter your age
* When people are saying something bad about a particular person, the beliefs about said person having said qualities is inscribed in people's minds (so, when something is said by the majority, it automatically becomes true), and thus you shouldn't allow anyone to say something bad about you
* Explain "respect"

Sections to add:
* The resume (projects list goes here)
* Self-dialogue

Other services to do:
* No-coin
* Nothing-ism
* Imaginary Worlds

Terms to explain (in *articles*, no need for another representation in my context):
* "Wrong human"
* "Correct human"
* "Powerless [and powerful, and underpowered, and overpowered] human"
