A very important detail: any webpage generated must not contain any interactive elements, so it can be printed on paper. There should also be "print versions" linked on every page (or only every article?) containing the same information as their web counterparts, but black and white and with less fancy things such as links (even those going to the same webpage (in-place anchors included)) and big outer margins.
