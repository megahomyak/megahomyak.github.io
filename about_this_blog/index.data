# About this blog

Hi. I am megahomyak, the author of this blog.

This blog's primary topic is "humans and their relations". I will try to explain how and why humans behave in a society and what useful tips we can derive from such knowledge. The things I talk about here are mostly fatalistic and depressing, but if you have this knowledge, you can use it to make the quality of your life higher and make less mistakes. It is not me being picky on topics, I'm just trying to talk about the things we don't like to bring up because it would spoil our moods, but actually those things are very important to understand to live in a society, and with our all-good policy we're making some people completely unaware of these dreadful, yet essential things. Every statement will be proven if possible, otherwise a warning sign will be placed.

If you don't like something about this blog or have something to add, you can send me a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/megahomyak/megahomyak.github.io) or {contact me}. I am open to a good discussion, but the unfounded criticism will not be answered.
