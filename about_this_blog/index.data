# About this blog

Hi. I am megahomyak, the author of this blog.

Lots of blogs were written about their authors, but this blog is not one of them. This blog is not about *me*. It is about *you*. The more accurate name for this kind of webpage would be a ["Virtual garden"](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners), but I want to keep it a "blog" for brevity.

If you don't like something about this blog or have something to add, you can send me a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/megahomyak/megahomyak.github.io) or {contact me}. I am open to a good discussion, but the unfounded criticism will not be answered.
