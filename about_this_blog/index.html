<p>Hi. I am megahomyak, the author of this blog.</p>
<p>A lot of blogs were written about their authors, but this blog is not one of them. This blog is not about <em>me</em>. It is about <em>you</em>. The more accurate name for this kind of webpage would be the <a href="https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners">"Virtual garden"</a>, but I want to keep it a "blog" for brevity.</p>
<p>If you don't like something about this blog or have something to add, you can send me a pull request on <a href="https://github.com/megahomyak/megahomyak.github.io">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://t.me/megahomyak">contact me on Telegram</a>. I am open to a good discussion, but the unfounded criticism will not be answered.</p>
